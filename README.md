# Not Lua

Ever wanted to write Lua programs in... not Lua? Well, you're in the
right place! Now you can also write them in Nix!

- features:
- it accidentally looks like lisp
- first-class Neovim support
- that's about it?
- please don't forget currying doesn't work

Simple examples: see [checks](./checks.nix).

Complex examples: see [my neovim config](https://github.com/chayleaf/dotfiles/blob/master/home/common/nvim.nix)
